  # Valentines Day Proposal

  A colorful, animated proposal website made to help you create a memorable Valentine surprise.

  ---

  ## Why this is cool

  - Smooth animations for a fun reveal experience
  - Easy to personalize with your own message and style
  - Great starter if you want to build a creative love-themed web project

  ---

  ## Quick start

  Install dependencies:

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

  Run the dev server:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

  ---

  ## Customize your website

  ### 1) Edit text and main content (`index.ts`)
  Update names, proposal text, button labels, and section content inside `index.ts` (or your main app entry file if it is named slightly differently in your setup).

  ### 2) Replace portrait image
  - Add your portrait image to the project assets/public images folder.
  - Update the portrait image path in your constants/config (look for portrait-related keys or image imports).
  - Keep image dimensions close to the original for the cleanest layout.

  Tip: Use a high-quality portrait (PNG or JPG) for the best visual result.
